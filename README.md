## Troubleshooting Google Sign-in Issues

### Common Problems and Solutions

#### 1. "This domain is not authorized for Google sign-in"
**Problem**: Firebase doesn't recognize your domain for OAuth redirects.

**Solutions**:
- Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Sign-in method ‚Üí Google
- Add your domain to "Authorized domains"
- For local development, add `localhost`
- For production, add your actual domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)

#### 2. "Pop-up was blocked by browser"
**Problem**: Browser security settings block the sign-in pop-up.

**Solutions**:
- Allow pop-ups for your website in browser settings
- Try using an incognito/private window
- Disable pop-up blockers temporarily
- The app will show a specific error message for this

#### 3. "Google sign-in is not enabled"
**Problem**: Google authentication provider is not enabled in Firebase.

**Solutions**:
- Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Sign-in method
- Find "Google" in the provider list
- Click "Enable" and configure the provider
- Add your support email

#### 4. "Network error" or connection issues
**Problem**: Unable to connect to Firebase services.

**Solutions**:
- Check your internet connection
- Verify Firebase configuration values are correct
- Make sure you're not behind a firewall blocking Firebase
- Try using a different network

#### 5. Local Development Issues
**Problem**: Issues when running locally (localhost).

**Solutions**:
- Ensure `localhost` is added to authorized domains in Firebase
- Use `http://localhost` instead of `http://127.0.0.1`
- Try different ports if using a local server
- Check browser console for CORS errors

### Debug Tools

The application includes built-in debugging tools:

1. **Open Browser Console** (F12 or right-click ‚Üí Inspect)
